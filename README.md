### **Build from Source**
1) Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
2) Run `npm i` in this directory to install node dependencies
3) Run `npm run lib` to build the library. (You can alternitively run using `dev` instead of `lib` to get access to development mode with code watching).
4) The project should be built and output to the `build/prod` folder as `lib.js` with the TS typings output to `build/prod/types`. (If you ran in development mode in step 3, the outputs will be in the `build/dev` folder instead.)
5) Copy the nessisary files into your project, and target `lib.js` as the module for imports.
